## Respawn Point
#### A Garry's Mod scripted entity that provides players with custom respawn point
Provides a custom respawn point for you. The device is located in the Entities/Respawn Point. Spawn it and use it so you will be assigned to that device (it's indicator will change from dim white to orange). You can be assigned to only one device at a time. Respawn Point recharges in 60 seconds for the first time and each time you respawn at it. Device is ready when it's indicator lights blue.
PS: Don't let the device take too much damage - it may explode! Give it a suit battery to slightly repair it.

I've created this addon while learning how entity and class system works in GMod Lua. I was inspired by Sleeping Bag from J.I. Defence Solutions addon, but coded it from scratch

To install as legacy addon, navigate to garrysmod/addons and execute
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mailz32/respawnpoint.git
```
